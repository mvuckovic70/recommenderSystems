Recommender System in R

Creating Recommender System in a movie industry

Recommender system serves as a cutting-edge machine learning tool for boosting sales and marketing activities in many industries. It predicts the items (movies, books, web pages, apps, etc.) a particular user (customer) could buy, and delivers the recommendation of the product(s) based on similarities of items and user preferences.

This project tackles the development of several recommender models, their prediction and evaluation.

The data is taken from a public dataset MovieLens (ml-latest-small.zip), available at http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
